    Here's what I like about lists:
    <ul>
        <li>They're useful for displaying lots of stuff</li>
        <li>That's about it</li>
        <li>I'm gunna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool</li>
    </ul>
    When you make a list, do it in this order:
    <ol>
        <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not</li>
        <li>If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag</li>
        <li>Use li tags nested in the list for your list items.
            <ul>
                <li>Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other</li>
            </ul>
        </li> <!--*IMPORTANT this must close here for our outside list to properly show 1., 2., 3., 4.-->
        <li>You've got this, I believe in you!</li>
    </ol>
